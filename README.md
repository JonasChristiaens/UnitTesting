# UnitTesting
For this project we were tasked to create an executable with the provided files and implement Unit Tests using either Google Test (GTest) or DocTest.
We were required to write tests for the functions, and were allowed to modify the code as we saw fit in order for all tests to pass.
We were also tasked to set this project up with CMake.

## How to Use
You are able to switch between 2 executables. The first one contains the executable of the original main.cpp and the second one contains the doctest file which I created in which I perform the tests.
